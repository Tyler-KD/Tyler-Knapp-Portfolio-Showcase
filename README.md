# Tyler-Knapp-Portfolio-Showcase

## Description

Tyler Knapp Portfolio Showcase was created to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position.  I built this project to apply currently learned core skills such as flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.  This project solves the problem of responsive design when viewing the webpage from different devices.  Some things I learned were that a mobile-first appraoch is the best strategy when trying to make a webpage accessible with aesthetically pleasing designs, typography should be emphasized because it makes a webpage stand out legibly, and CSS variables at the root of the document can be easily referenced and save time.

## Usage

This portfolio can be used to gain a better understanding of responsive design by interacting with the layout.  All the links respond to their respective sections or deployed web applications.  Mousing over links and application images changes the style through various properties such as background color, text color, and opacity.  To view various breakpoints in the viewport, open up the DevTools console in Chrome by "right clicking" anywhere on the page and selecting "Inspect."  Pulling the scroll bar horizontally showcases how elements lay in rows or columns, disappearing border lines, and footer background color changes in response to different device pixel widths.  All of these layout changes give a more pleasant viewing from devices such as tablets, large smartphones, and small smartphones.
